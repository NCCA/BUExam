\titledquestion{Zombies in films}
Consider Zombies in films. 
\begin{parts}
\part[5] Name some films with Zombies \droppoints
\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pride and Prejudice... with Zombies!
\item Abraham Lincoln... Zombie Hunter!
\item etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

% Maths example
\part[10] State the average number of characters eaten by a single Zombie in "`28 Days Later"'. Use the following formula: \droppoints
\begin{align}
\bar{x} &= \frac{1}{n}\cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \nonumber
\end{align}
\begin{solution}
At least 3. Zombies are awesome.
\end{solution}

\titledquestion{Zombie Programming}
Consider the following code segment:
\begin{CPP}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
\end{CPP}
\begin{parts}
%Example of code inclusion
\part In your own words, explain:
\begin{subparts}
\subpart[5] Was this code produced by a Zombie? If so, why?\droppoints
\begin{solution}
Clearly, the lameness indicates that it is Zombie generated code (ZGC).
\end{solution}
\subpart[5] How would you improve on the above code? \droppoints 
\begin{solution}
Don't use the std namespace! Better to give your fingers exercise and type it every time.
\end{solution}
\end{subparts}

\part[10] Write a page essay on any topic you like. Appropriate use of references required.\droppoints
\begin{solution}
 Blah Blah Blah
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\titledquestion{Zombie Algorithms}
\begin{parts}

% Example of an algorithm
 \part[10] Consider the following algorithm:

\begin{algorithmic}
\REQUIRE $n \geq 0$
\ENSURE $y = x^n$
\STATE $y \leftarrow 1$
\STATE $X \leftarrow x$
\STATE $N \leftarrow n$
\WHILE{$N \neq 0$}
\IF{$N$ is even}
\STATE $X \leftarrow X \times X$
\STATE $N \leftarrow N / 2$
\ELSE[$N$ is odd]
\STATE $y \leftarrow y \times X$
\STATE $N \leftarrow N - 1$
\ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
Describe in your own words the thought processes required for a Zombie to generate this algorithm. How can the promise of fresh brains serve as a motivators? \droppoints
\begin{solution}
Blah blah blah.
\end{solution}

% Example of image inclusion
\part[5] Admire our institution's mighty logo:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{bulogo.pdf}
\end{center}
Draw this in a manner similar to a Zombie. Coloured pens are provided.\droppoints
\begin{solution}
Blah blah blah.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

% The postamble is needed as part of the uni style. (this cannot be automatic as AtEndOfDocument adds a \newpage)
